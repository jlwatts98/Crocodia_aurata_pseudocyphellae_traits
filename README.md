# Crocodia_aurata_pseudocyphellae_traits
This repository holds the code used to reproduce the analyses and graphs for the paper entitled: The role of pseudocyphellae and thallus traits in modulating water relations of the lichen Crocodia aurata (Ach.) Link (Peltigeraceae) across a moisture gradient in a Costa Rican premontane tropical forest.

# Scripts
1.) 
pages_model.R - This script implements Pages' model to estimate drying rate (k) from drying curve data.
2.)
figure_3.R - This is a long script that implements best subset multiple linear regressions to predict drying rate from pseudocyphellae and thallus traits. It also includes other exploratory analyses.
3.)
figure_4.R - This script implements an analysis of variance on thallus thickness across sites.

# Data
